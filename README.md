# 🤖 Project NEXABOT — The 4-Wheel Explorer

> *"Built from curiosity, coded with dreams, and driven by purpose — meet KUNALBOT, my very first step into the symphony of simulation and robotics."*

## 🧭 About the Project

**NEXABOT** is a **4-wheel differential drive robot** built using **ROS2**, **Gazebo**, and **RViz**, designed and developed completely from scratch by **Kunal Jadhav** — a passionate Robotics Software Engineer in the making.

This project marks my journey into the world of **robotic simulation and autonomous navigation**.  
It demonstrates the connection between the **physical robot design (URDF)** and the **virtual environment** using the ROS2–Gazebo bridge.
