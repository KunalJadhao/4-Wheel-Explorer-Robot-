# 🤖 Project KUNALBOT — The 4-Wheel Explorer

> *"Built from curiosity, coded with dreams, and driven by purpose — meet KUNALBOT, my very first step into the symphony of simulation and robotics."*

## 🧭 About the Project

**KUNALBOT** is a **4-wheel differential drive robot** built using **ROS2**, **Gazebo**, and **RViz**, designed and developed completely from scratch by **Kunal Jadhav** — a passionate Robotics Software Engineer in the making.

This project marks my journey into the world of **robotic simulation and autonomous navigation**.  
It demonstrates the connection between the **physical robot design (URDF)** and the **virtual environment** using the ROS2–Gazebo bridge.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Source the workspace
```bash
cd ~/kunal_ws
source install/setup.bash

2️⃣ Launch the robot in RViz

ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.xml

3️⃣ Launch the robot in Gazebo

ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_gazebo.launch.xml

4️⃣ Connect ROS2 with Gazebo

ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge /clock@rosgraph_msgs/msg/Clock[gz.msgs.Clock]

🧠 Features
