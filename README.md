Got it, Homie 💪 — here’s your **final clean version** of the `README.md` file.
This version fixes the formatting issue so that the **“Features”** section doesn’t merge into the code block when you paste it into GitHub — ready for **direct copy-paste** use.

# 🤖 Project KUNALBOT — The 4-Wheel Explorer

> *"Built from curiosity, coded with dreams, and driven by purpose — meet KUNALBOT, my very first step into the symphony of simulation and robotics."*

---

## 🧭 About the Project

**KUNALBOT** is a **4-wheel differential drive robot** built using **ROS2**, **Gazebo**, and **RViz**, designed and developed completely from scratch by **Kunal Jadhav** — a passionate Robotics Software Engineer in the making.

This project marks my journey into the world of **robotic simulation and autonomous navigation**.  
It demonstrates the connection between the **physical robot design (URDF)** and the **virtual environment** using the ROS2–Gazebo bridge.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **ROS2 Humble** | Robot middleware for nodes, topics, and parameters |
| **Gazebo Fortress** | Physics simulation for the 4-wheel robot |
| **RViz2** | Visualization of robot model and transformations |
| **URDF/Xacro** | Defines robot structure, links, and joints |
| **ros_gz_bridge** | Connects Gazebo simulation with ROS2 topics |

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Source the workspace
```bash
cd ~/kunal_ws
source install/setup.bash
````

### 2️⃣ Launch the robot in RViz

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.xml
```

### 3️⃣ Launch the robot in Gazebo

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_gazebo.launch.xml
```

### 4️⃣ Connect ROS2 with Gazebo

```bash
ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge /clock@rosgraph_msgs/msg/Clock[gz.msgs.Clock]
```
