# 🤖 TERRABOT — The Four-Wheeled ROS2 Explorer

Welcome to **TERRABOT**, a simulated **4-wheel mobile robot** built with **ROS2**, **Gazebo**, and **RViz**.  
Designed and developed by *Kunal* — this project represents the first step into a world where simulation meets imagination.  
A simple, elegant, and modular setup to explore robot kinematics, control, and visualization in the ROS2 ecosystem. 🌌

---

## 🧭 Overview

TERRABOT is a **differential drive robot** simulated in **Gazebo Fortress** and visualized in **RViz**.  
It uses ROS2 launch files to bring together URDF descriptions, joint states, and Gazebo bridges for complete integration.  
Think of it as your personal foundation stone for mastering **robot simulation** and **ROS2 architecture**.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

Before running TERRABOT, ensure that you have:
- **ROS2 Humble (or later)** installed  
- **Gazebo Fortress / Garden** installed and working  
- All dependencies sourced correctly  

Clone the repository and build:

```bash
cd ~/kunal_ws/src
git clone <your_repo_link_here>
cd ..
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
````

## 🚀 How to Run

Run the robot step-by-step:

### 🧩 Step 1: Launch the URDF in RViz

Visualize your robot’s model and transforms:

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.xml
```

### 🌍 Step 2: Launch the Simulation in Gazebo

Bring the robot to life in the virtual world:

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_gazebo.launch.xml
```

### 🔗 Step 3: Bridge Gazebo with ROS2 Topics

Enable real-time communication between Gazebo and ROS2:

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_bringup ros_gazebo_bridge.launch.xml
```

### 🕹️ Step 4: Control and Experiment

Use teleop or custom scripts to move your TERRABOT around your simulated world.
