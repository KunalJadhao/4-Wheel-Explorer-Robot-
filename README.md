# 🤖 Project NEXABOT — The 4-Wheel Explorer

> *"Built from curiosity, coded with dreams, and driven by purpose — meet NEXABOT, my very first step into the symphony of simulation and robotics."*

## 🧭 About the Project

**NEXABOT** is a **4-wheel differential drive robot** built using **ROS2**, **Gazebo**, and **RViz**, designed and developed completely from scratch by **Kunal Jadhav** — a passionate Robotics Software Engineer in the making.

This project marks my journey into the world of **robotic simulation and autonomous navigation**.  
It demonstrates the connection between the **physical robot design (URDF)** and the **virtual environment** using the ROS2–Gazebo bridge.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **ROS2 Humble** | Robot middleware for nodes, topics, and parameters |
| **Gazebo Fortress** | Physics simulation for the 4-wheel robot |
| **RViz2** | Visualization of robot model and transformations |
| **URDF/Xacro** | Defines robot structure, links, and joints |
| **ros_gz_bridge** | Connects Gazebo simulation with ROS2 topics |


## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

Before running TERRABOT, ensure that you have the right tools ready:

### 🧰 Requirements

* **ROS2 Humble (or newer)**
* **Gazebo Fortress / Garden**
* Properly sourced ROS2 environment

### 🚀 Build & Source

Let’s bring your workspace to life:

```bash
cd ~/kunal_ws/src
git clone <your_repo_link_here>
cd ..
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

✨ *Your environment is now ready to awaken TERRABOT.*

💡 **What’s new in this version:**

* Center-aligned title (looks stunning on GitHub)
* Large, bold, and emoji-balanced header
* Centered subtitle with your name & tagline
* Clean horizontal rules for flow
* Poetic + professional feel
* Placeholder for banner image at the end (optional)

---

Would you like me to **design a banner image** (like a futuristic one saying “TERRABOT — The Four-Wheeled ROS2 Explorer”) to match this style? It’ll sit perfectly under that centered title and complete the professional GitHub look.

## 🚀 How to Run

Run the robot step-by-step:

### 🧩 Step 1: Launch the URDF in RViz

Visualize your robot’s model and transforms:

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_description display.launch.xml
```

### 🌍 Step 2: Launch the Simulation in Gazebo

Bring the robot to life in the virtual world:

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_gazebo.launch.xml
```

### 🔗 Step 3: Bridge Gazebo with ROS2 Topics

Enable real-time communication between Gazebo and ROS2:

```bash
ros2 launch my_robot_bringup ros_gazebo_bridge.launch.xml
```

### 🕹️ Step 4: Control and Experiment

Use teleop or custom scripts to move your TERRABOT around your simulated world.
